# STYLE GUIDE 

### Main look 

A4 pages.

Keep style (i.e. hierarchy of headings) consistent across sections 

Format paragraphs such that they flow (e.g. separate columns should have same width; maybe use `inline` option to condense them to a rectangular shape etc. ).  Whatever looks good. 

Page numbers (either bottom or top; should not be 'in the way') 

'Coffee table' book style (with double spread, white-space oriented design with paragraphs / columns of text; sometimes with images that complement the placement of text. 

Sometimes a full page can be used for a particular object for emphasis (e.g. a whole page for a new 'chapter' heading; or a whole page for one image )

Use images from source if applicable (e.g. if talking about Garvan institute; find a stock photo from Garvan (and credit with a `SOURCE: <source>` caption (in small font that isn't too visible))

### Style choices 

Main font: Helvetica (for headings, etc. )

Alternative fonts: DecimaMono (where applicable), times new roman (?) for 'article' type sections 

*NOTE: do whatever is most appropriate (look through other 'coffee table' type spreads with a similar aesthetic -- what do they choose?  *

### Colour 

For now, aim for the same as BINFsights (i.e. dark gray text, etc. )  

Leave pages as pure white for now
